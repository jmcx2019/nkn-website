  faq: {
    name: 'FAQ',
    q1: 'How do NKN team came up with NKN concept?',
    a1: 'In the past few years, we have been engaged in the development of blockchains and have completed quite a few blockchain systems. ' +
    'However, we have been doing decentralized peer to peer network research and development long before doing blockchain. ' +
    'For example WiFi-based mesh networks, and some actual decentralized data relay and transmission system deployment. ' +
    'Because one of the core principles of the blockchain itself is to decentralize the network, we have been thinking ' +
    'about how to use this feature of the blockchain better to solve the problem of idle network connectivity and ' +
    'transmission capability. Through blockchain’s self-incentive mechanism, there is an opportunity to promote the ' +
    'continuous development and expansion of the decentralized network. At the same time, we also see that there is ' +
    'currently no blockchain system that can do a good job of implementing network resources tokenization. Well, ' +
    'we are wondering, can we combine this with our background and expertise to make a network system that everyone ' +
    'can participate in and build it together? That will fundamentally solve many of the problems of today’s Internet, ' +
    'such as network fragmentation and network neutrality. So, here comes the NKN project.',
    q2: 'Who is Yanbo Li?',
    a2: 'Yanbo Li is the founder of NKN project. He loves coding, and have done quite a few open source projects both ' +
    'in blockchain as well as wireless networking stacks. In the last two years, he was the co-founder of OnChain and ' +
    'core developer for DNA (Distributed Network Architecture) open source project. He led a team of highly talented ' +
    'developers in Beijing and California. As a hobby, Yanbo practices boxing which keeps his mind and body sharp! ' +
    'So in a sense he is more Rambo than Lambo.',
    q3: 'How big the NKN team is? Is it centralized geographically?',
    a3: 'NKN is an ambitious project and needs lots of talents. Our solution is not an army of software engineers, but rather a combination of excellent core developers, open source, re-use of existing solutions where applicable, and a network of community contributors. We have about 10 developers already, who have extensive coding experience in blockchain and networking software stack. Our team are distributed between China and US. In addition, we have researchers in universities and research labs such as Dr. Diffie’s Cryptic Labs that are working on the fundamental cryptography and algorithms. These are the key talents form our core developer group. We will not reinvent the wheels, and will use open source components and existing algorithms in conjunction with our own contribution. We believe in building on the shoulder of giants. In addition, the previous code base in DNA can be used to speed up development in the initial prototype and Proof of Concept phase. Although long term, many of the core components will be rewritten from ground up. But it gave us a sandbox to do key new component development. We will also strive to build a vibrant open source community, where community developers can contribute to the NKN open source project where they are most interested. This includes not only implementation itself, but also the detailed design. And they can be rewards either in tokens or kudos.',
    q4: 'What is Cellular Automata?',
    a4: 'Cellular Automata is a concept we have been very interested in for a while now. In layman’s terms, it is a powerful tool to model complex systems by using simple rules. It has been applied in artificial intelligence such as neural network, network routing, and cryptography.\n' +
    'Cellular Automata has a few unique characteristics that are extremely attractive for network routing as well as scalable consensus algorithm: - Truly equal peers - Simple rules - Native parallel processing - Dynamic - Decentralized: local decision, global impact - Open and expandable\n' +
    'By finding the right rules and initial state, you can classify the system into 4 kinds of states. Class 1 “Homogeneous and Stable”, is very useful for consensus. Class 4 “Edge of Chaos”, can be explored for dynamic routing with some randomness.\n' +
    'We have witnessed failures of many over-complex software systems. Cellular Automata inspires us to solve complex network routing and consensus problem not by modelling the entire system, but rather focusing on the simple rules that define how individual nodes interact with each other. This is the essence of decentralized system, and Cellular Automata concept fits right in.',
    q5: 'How to utilize Cellular Automata in NKN?',
    a5: 'Cellular Automata is a concept and methodology that will guide the design and implementation of NKN protocol and system. So it will be useful for dynamic network routing as well as consensus algorithm. Our additional contribution is using the Ising model in Physics to mathematically prove that whether a CA rule is convergent, and also mathematically guide us to find the suitable rules. Thus we do not have to exhaustively searching among millions of potential rules.',
    q6: 'What are the advantages of using Cellular Automata methodology?',
    a6: 'The model based on Cellular Automata has some outstanding features, such as true decentralization and equality between nodes, which can run concurrently and is very easy to scale. These features are very much in line with the NKN network we are building. At the same time, the rules of interaction between individuals are relatively simple and easy to define, which contributes to straightforward and robust implementation. Cellular Automata has a few unique characteristics that are extremely attractive for network routing as well as scalable consensus algorithm : - Truly equal peers: decentralized, no dependency on seed or core nodes - Simple rules: easy to implement, simpler code, less errors, consume less resource so potentially working on millions of mobile devices - Native parallel processing: highly scalable - Dynamic: network topology can evolve with a touch of randomness, difficult to detect network traffic pattern, more resistant to attacks - Decentralized: local decision, global impact - Open and expandable.',
    q7: 'How dApps would interact with NKN?',
    a7: 'dApps can use NKN API to utilize our network connectivity and traffic relay function on the networking layer. In addition, dApp will interact with the incentive layer for billing or mining. So dApp can be both consumer of as well as supplier for NKN network. In the future, we can explore providing NKN protocol to other blockchain system as their network layer. We can also explore opportunities to use NKN as a platform to dApp to issue their own token and write their own smart contracts. But those are longer term possibilities, and not our current focus. We need to make the foundation very solid. One concrete example of what dApp can benefit from NKN is truly P2P messaging application. Today, because most of us are behind NAT (Network Address Translation) with private IP address as well as firewall, we have to rely on a central server to relay message. This applies to WhatsApp, FB Messenger, and Telegram. By using the NKN network, a messaging dApp can enable decentralized P2P messaging from day one without its own server infrastructure.',
    q8: 'What is DDTN in NKN?',
    a8: 'Decentralized Data Transmission Network NKN introduced the concept of Decentralized Data Transmission Network (DDTN). DDTN combines multiple independent and self-organized relay nodes to provide clients with connectivity and data transmission capability. This coordination is decentralized and does not require trust of any involved parties. The secure operation of NKN is achieved through a consensus mechanism that coordinates and validates the operations performed by each node. DDTN provides a variety of strategies for decentralized application (DApp). In contrast to centralized network connectivity and data transmission, there are multiple efficient paths between nodes in DDTN, which can be used to enhance data transmission capacity. Native tokens can incentivize the sharing of network resources, and eventually minimize wasted connectivity and bandwidth. Such a property is termed "self-incentivized".',
    q9: 'What are NKN fundamental goals?',
    a9: 'Our slogan sums up our fundamental goal quite well “Free the bits, rebuild the Internet we always wanted”. To break down into more specific goals: We want to - Connect anyone at anyplace - Secure net neutrality from network layer - Make the Internet always open and scalable - Reward resource sharing and improve connectivity for everyone - Build the world’s largest Internet bandwidth exchange',
    q10: 'What are the benefits that are not found in your competitors?',
    a10: 'People often ask us, what is different about NKN compared to other projects in the networking space. Some projects are entirely focusing on mobile phones and using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi Direct. NKN intend to change the entire Internet, including fixed and mobile, phones, laptops, edge and core network. NKN is a protocol overlay that is independent of the underlying physical communication media, and transparent to applications. In addition, most networking projects are based on Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens and smart contracts. We are not sure if Ethereum will be scalable for millions or millions of nodes, and petabytes of traffic. NKN will have its own blockchain technology that will have fundamentally new Proof of Relay and new consensus algorithms that will be newly developed specifically for tokenizing the network transmission capabilities. Compared to some projects, NKN have a much broader scope. We want to tokenize networking like what IPFS did to storage. Our target is the 1 trillion dollar communications business, and how we can provide better connectivity to everyone by incentivize the sharing of unused networking resources, expanding and upgrading the sharing network.',
    q11: 'Do you aim to form a big NKN community?',
    a11: 'Absolutely, we would love to form a big community. We are not focusing only on making the community bigger, but more importantly a higher quality community. That community will embrace technology, use, improve, and expand NKN network, participate in NKN core software and application development, support new users.',
