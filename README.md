##### WHAT IS NKN
NKN (New Kind of Network) is a new project aiming to rebuild the Internet that will be truly open, decentralized, dynamic, safe, shared and owned by the community. 

NKN intend to introduce Cellular Automata to innovate on several major layers in the entire stack. 

First of all, the project will address the network decentralization in a broad sense, starting from application connectivity, to networking protocol. 

Secondly, the project intend to improve the underlying blockchain technology to achieve efficient and fair consensus without sacrificing node equality and decentralization. 

Finally the project will leverage blockchain to maximize network resource utilization and incentivize community driven network creation, participation and expansion.
